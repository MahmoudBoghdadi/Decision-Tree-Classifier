# Decision Tree Classifier for Predictive Analysis

# Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Decision Tree classifier developed during my internship at The Spart Foundation. The model is designed to predict the class of new data instances based on features learned during training.

# Introduction
The Decision Tree classifier is a machine learning algorithm that builds a tree-like model for making decisions. In this project, the model is trained to predict the class of new data instances based on learned patterns from a given dataset.

# Model Training
The model training process is documented in the Jupyter notebook (Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm.ipynb). This notebook contains the code and explanations for loading the dataset, preprocessing, training the Decision Tree model, and evaluating its performance.

# Results
After training the model, the results, including performance metrics and visualizations, are presented in the Jupyter notebook. Explore the notebook to understand how well the Decision Tree model performs on the given dataset.

# Predicting New Data
To predict the class of new data instances, you can use the trained model by providing the relevant features as input. Check the notebook for instructions on how to make predictions with new data.
